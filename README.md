# HistoryNow
HistoryNow is a project to document recent events (currently 2000s), in a history book format. 

Current scope is to be online and editable by anyone. Physical copies are not planned yet, but they may be announced in the future.

Our goal is to be unbiased, and report events easily, and live.

*Content may not be updated in live time and may be out of date.
**I'll try to keep things unbiased, but this is made to be editable by anyone, so inaccuracy may occur, and content may be stubbed.
